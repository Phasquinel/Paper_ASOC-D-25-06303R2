###Definition of dataset variables####
The variables contained in the Rev_Application_Data file are:

TC = total cholesterol; 
HDL = “good” cholesterol;
GLI = stabilized glucose; 
RCH = TC/HDL ratio;
HBGy = glycosylated hemoglobin; 
Age = measured in years;
GEN = F (0) and M (1); 
HEIGHT = measured in meters;
Body WEIGHT (BW) = measured in kg; 
BMI = body mass index;
WAIST = measured in cm;
HIPS = measured in cm. 

######Definition of response variables for each of the applications#####
Using the variables, the following response variables are obtained: 

Response variable (y_1), which corresponds to the ratio between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and total cholesterol (TC), denoted by HDL/TC, is distributed near the lower limit of the standard unit interval. (Y near zero)

The response variable was considered an indicator of abdominal obesity (y_2), defined as the ratio of waist circumference to height. This measurement is within the standard unit range and is used to assess the risk of heart disease. (Y around 0.5)

Response variable (y_3) - ratio between non-HDL cholesterol and total cholesterol, NHDL/TC. (Y near one)

######Reproducibility of application II########

The dataset (CCA_OX_CENTER) used in application II, when Y is around 0.5, is available in the repository.

When running the code in Ox (Beta_Reg_Code_App_II), ensure that the dataset is in the same folder as the code.
